# **Project: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are early biomarkers of multi-domain disability progression in progressive MS**

**Project background**
In multiple sclerosis (MS), depression and anxiety are common, yet their relation to disease progression is unclear. We investigated whether Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) symptoms predict neurological disability progression.

**Project methods**
In our prospective cohort of people with primary progressive MS (PPMS), depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the HADS. Disability progression at 1 and 2 years was defined by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a 3-variable composite endpoint (EDSS, Timed 25-Foot Walk; T25FW, or Arm Function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire; AMSQ), or a 5-variable composite endpoint (EDSS, T25FW, AMSQ, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), or Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS)). Logistic regression modelled whether HADS scores predicted disability progression. Boruta feature selection identified the most informative HADS items.

This script focuses on the **prediction with logistic regression and Boruta feature selection**

1. bootstrap of cross-validation process of logistic regression, use HADS scores to predict disease progression
2. Boruta feature selection to find the most influental question from HADS questionnaire
3. bootstrap of cross-validation process of logistic model, but using only the most influental questions from Boruta selection to predict disease progression
